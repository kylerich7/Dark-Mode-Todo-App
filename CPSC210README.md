# To-Do List

## My CPSC 210 Personal Project

### What will the application do?  
Allow users to interact with a user interface that allows them to:
- add and delete tasks including a date, description, a category, and priority
- mark any task as completed
- delete any task
- filter tasks based on their category, priority, days until they are due, or their completion status
    - be able to select if they want the tasks to be shown to meet at least one filter selected
    - be able to select if they want the tasks to be shown to meet all the filters selected

In a general sense, the application will allow users to better organize their tasks and deadlines in a simple, clean
manor.

### Who will use it?
Anyone who wants to organize their tasks in a clear, easy to understand way. This will include, but is not limited to
- students
- business owners
- people with busy schedules

### Why is this project of interest to me?
I used this project as a stepping stone to develop the skills needed to create a larger scale productivity
project at a later date. I have been obsessed with finding new and better ways to increase my daily productivity 
for years. Last year, this obsession resulted in the creation of a big Microsoft Excel program that makes completing 
daily objectives and habits into a game. After setting your daily habits and objectives, you receive XP points for 
completing them daily. Furthermore, you can set weekly/monthly XP point goals, and compete amongst your friends,
to stay motivated. Given that I built this on excel, however, its functionality is limited, and I am not able to
implement all of the features I would like to. Ultimately, my goal is to extend the knowledge I gain from this project
into creating the prior
mentioned habit game project. **In a nutshell, productivity and finding new ways to stay organized is what drives me,
and is the reason behind the creation of this todolist.**
