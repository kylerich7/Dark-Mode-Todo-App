# Todo List App (Dark Mode)
I built this todo list app for my final project in CPSC 210 at UBC. The todo app is rich with features and has a beautiful gui built with Java Swing.
In a general sense, this application allows users to better organize their tasks and deadlines in a simple, clean
manor.

## Motivation
I used this project as a stepping stone to develop the skills needed to create a larger scale productivity
project at a later date. Last year,I made a big Microsoft Excel program that makes completing
daily objectives and habits into a game. After setting your daily habits and objectives, you receive XP points for
completing them daily. Furthermore, you can set weekly/monthly XP point goals, and compete amongst your friends,
to stay motivated. Given that I built this on Excel, however, its functionality is limited, and I am not able to
implement all the features I would like to. Ultimately, my goal is to extend the knowledge I gain from this project
into creating the prior
mentioned habit game project. **In a nutshell, productivity and finding new ways to stay organized is what drives me,
and is the reason behind the creation of this todolist.**
