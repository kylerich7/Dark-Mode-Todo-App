# Todo List App (Dark Mode)
I built this todo list app for my final project in CPSC 210 at UBC. The todo app is rich with features and has a dark mode gui built with Java Swing.
This application allows users to better organize their tasks and deadlines in a simple, clean
manor.

## Motivation
I used this project as a stepping stone to develop the skills needed to create a larger scale productivity
project at a later date. Last year,I made a big Microsoft Excel program that makes completing
daily objectives and habits into a game. After setting your daily habits and objectives, you receive XP points for
completing them daily. Furthermore, you can set weekly/monthly XP point goals, and compete amongst your friends,
to stay motivated. Given that I built this on Excel, however, its functionality is limited, and I am not able to
implement all the features I would like to. Ultimately, my goal is to extend the knowledge I gain from this project
into creating the prior
mentioned habit game project. **In a nutshell, productivity and finding new ways to stay organized is what drives me,
and is the reason behind the creation of this todolist.**

## Features
- add a task (or multiple) to to-do list
    - name
    - due date
    - category
    - priority
- delete any task from to-do list
- mark a task as completed
- view all tasks
- view/filter the tasks that meet any one of (or all of) certain attributes, including:
    - status of the task (if completed)
    - if the task is overdue (due date has passed and task is not complete)
    - if the task is due today, within a week, or within a month
    - what priority the task has
    - what category the task has
- load a to-do list from a file
- save to-do list to a file
- activate and deactivate auto-save
- sounds play when preforming certain actions
